You are using a model of type llava to instantiate a model of type llava_llama. This is not supported for all configurations of models and can yield errors.

Some weights of LlavaLlamaForCausalLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b and are newly initialized: ['model.granular_mm_projector.0.bias', 'model.granular_mm_projector.0.weight', 'model.granular_mm_projector.2.bias', 'model.granular_mm_projector.2.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
